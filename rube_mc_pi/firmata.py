"""
Adaptor for Arduino Firmata protocol.

NOTE:  This plugin is experimental as there has not been time to test it with
real ardunios at the time of writing.  The plugin is currently a simple port 
of the GPIO code to use the Firmata API.

The JSON config looks like this:

        "type": "firmata",
