"""
Adaptor for scratch using the scratchpy interface

To function as a source, the scratch program should just broadcast a block state
e.g. broadcast 41,0

To function as a target, the scratch program should listen for broadcasts saying
either BLOCK_PRESENT or BLOCK_ABSENT.  Implementation of individual block types
has not yet been implemented

The JSON config looks like this:

    { "source": {
        "type": "scratchplug",
        "server_address": "localhost",
        "server_port": 42001 
        },
        
      "target":  {
        "type": "scratchplug",
        "server_address": "localhost",
        "server_port": 42001 
        }
    }
